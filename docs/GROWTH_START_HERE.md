## Purpose

This is the onboarding index for the AISkillScore Growth Memory System.  
Use this page first, then move through the documents in the recommended order.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `docs/GROWTH_MEMORY_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` (umbrella governance)
2. `docs/AI_SEARCH_COPY_PLAYBOOK.md` (SEO/GEO execution patterns)
3. `docs/PAIN_INTENT_KEYWORD_MAP.md` (persona + pain + keyword targeting)
4. `docs/MONETIZATION_ROI_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` (pricing/paywall monetization logic)
5. `docs/TOKEN_ECONOMY_OPTIMIZATION_BLUEPRINT.md` (token system optimization constraints)
6. `docs/GROWTH_ROLLOUT_KPI_GUARDRAILS.md` (rollout stages, KPI and rollback gates)
7. `docs/templates/GROWTH_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` (reusable generation templates)
8. `docs/GROWTH_CONTENT_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` (pre-publish controls)
9. `docs/GROWTH_EXPERIMENT_RUN_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` (experiment logging standard)

## Persistent Rule Enforcement

- `.cursor/rules/growth-copy-system.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/monetization-roi-system.mdc`

## Quick Operating Flow

1. Pick persona + intent from the keyword map.
2. Draft using the prompt library.
3. Validate with the execution checklist.
4. Roll out using KPI guardrails.
5. Log outcomes and update templates/rules.

## Redundancy and Retirement Policy

- Keep specialized docs separate when they serve distinct workflows.
- Retire a file only if its guidance is fully superseded by a canonical source.
- When retiring, add a short deprecation note pointing to the replacement document.

Current status: no file is retired in this v1 set; overlap is intentional for operational speed.
