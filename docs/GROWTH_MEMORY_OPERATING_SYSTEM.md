# AISkillScore Growth Memory Operating System

Version: 1.0  
Owner: Growth + Product + Content  
Last updated: 2026-02-20  
Review cadence: Monthly

## 1) Purpose

This document is the persistent operating system for growth content and monetization copy decisions at AISkillScore.  
Use it as the default control plane for:

- Organic SEO content
- AI/LLM search citation content
- Product and lifecycle copy
- Pricing/paywall/token economy messaging
- Experiment design and interpretation

## 2) Source Precedence (Resolve Conflicts In This Order)

1. `UNIFIED_MASTER_PLAN.md`
2. `SPRINT_NEXT.md`
3. `PRD.md`
4. `BRAND_SYSTEM.md`
5. `SEO_AI_STRATEGY.md`
6. `docs/BRAND_MESSAGE_MATRIX.md`
7. This document

If a lower-priority source conflicts with a higher-priority source, update the lower one.

## 3) Brand Non-Negotiables

- Category: `AI-powered career intelligence platform`
- Master promise: `Stop guessing. Know exactly where you stand.`
- Currency term: always `tokens` (never credits/points in user-facing copy)
- Trust stance:
  - Never hallucinate user facts
  - Never guarantee outcomes
  - Always separate assessment from certainty
- Value stance:
  - Premium quality + fair value
  - No subscription lock-in as primary differentiator
  - Price comparisons must include capability differences

## 4) Message Hierarchy (Use In Order)

1. User pain and uncertainty
2. Diagnostic clarity (what is wrong and why)
3. Action path (what to do next)
4. Mechanism (how AISkillScore does it)
5. Evidence (why this is credible)
6. CTA with low-friction entry

## 5) Canonical Claim Format

Every externally-visible growth claim must use:

1. Claim
2. Mechanism
3. Evidence

### Pass Rules

- Includes all three fields
- Evidence is verifiable and current
- No certainty language for probabilistic outcomes
- No unsupported superlatives

### Fail Rules

- "Guaranteed interview" style claims
- Vague mechanism ("AI magic")
- Data claims without source context
- Price-only superiority without capability comparison

## 6) Core Persona + Pain Framework

The six operating personas are canonical and should drive content targeting:

- Career pivoter
- AI-anxious software engineer
- Recent graduate / early career
- Finance-to-fintech transitioner
- Healthcare remote seeker
- Senior creative professional

For each persona, all copy work must answer:

- What they fear losing
- What outcome they want fastest
- What proof they require before paying
- Which objection blocks action
- What "next step" they can take in under 5 minutes

## 7) Content Lifecycle (Reusable Sprint Loop)

### Stage A: Brief

- Choose persona + funnel stage + search intent
- Define page type (guide, comparison, alternative, role page, FAQ, lifecycle email)
- Lock primary KPI and secondary KPI
- Define one main CTA and one fallback CTA

### Stage B: Draft

- Use answer-first opening (40-60 words)
- Use structured H2/H3 query-style sections
- Include claim-mechanism-evidence blocks
- Add one clear "next action" at section end

### Stage C: QA

- Brand compliance (terms, tone, non-negotiables)
- Factual integrity and source freshness
- Persona fit and pain relevance
- AI-search readability and structure checks
- Monetization fairness checks for pricing-related assets

### Stage D: Publish

- Ensure metadata, schema, and internal links are present
- Log release in growth run log
- Set first review checkpoint (7/14/30 days)

### Stage E: Refresh

- Update stale stats and examples quarterly
- Expand or prune based on search + conversion signals
- Fold winning experiments into canonical templates

## 8) AI/LLM Search Writing Standard

All high-intent content should be:

- Answer-first in the opening block
- Easily chunked by clear headings
- Fact-anchored with named sources where needed
- Query-matched in heading phrasing
- Internally linked to deeper decision pages (tools, pricing, compare)

### Required Structure For SEO/GEO Pages

1. Direct answer intro
2. Who this is for
3. Common mistakes
4. Recommended process
5. AISkillScore mechanism and evidence
6. FAQ
7. Next-step CTA

## 9) Conversion + Monetization Messaging Rules

- Lead with outcome and trust, then cost
- Keep pay-per-use framing visible
- Use top-up options to reduce mission interruption
- Use larger packs as value anchors, not forced defaults
- Keep pricing transparent and explain token economics plainly

## 10) Governance Protocol For New Content Requests

When a new request arrives:

1. Classify request type (SEO, conversion copy, pricing, lifecycle, social)
2. Map to persona and intent
3. Pull canonical terms and claims
4. Draft using template from prompt library
5. Run QA checklist
6. Log experiment assumptions and KPI targets

## 11) Documentation Map (Companion Files)

This OS is supported by:

- `docs/GROWTH_START_HERE.md`
- `docs/AI_SEARCH_COPY_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `docs/PAIN_INTENT_KEYWORD_MAP.md`

## 12) Success Definition

This system is successful when:

- Team can produce consistent copy without re-arguing fundamentals
- AI-search-ready structure is standard on every priority page
- Copy drift is minimized across product and marketing surfaces
- Monetization copy improves conversion without trust erosion
- Every sprint logs hypotheses, outcomes, and template updates
