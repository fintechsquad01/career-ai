# Growth Next Steps Plan: Organic Search + AI/LLM Authority (90 Days)

Owner: Growth + Content + Product Marketing  
Status: Draft execution plan (docs-only)  
Constraint: No live impact until explicit approval

## Primary Goal

Increase qualified organic traffic and AI/LLM citation visibility while preserving trust, messaging integrity, and rollout safety.

## KPI Targets (90-Day)

- Organic sessions (non-brand): increase steadily week over week.
- SERP/AI-overview CTR: improve on newly optimized pages.
- Content-to-tool CTR: maintain or exceed 6% on high-intent pages.
- Content-assisted signup conversion: sustained upward trend.
- AI citation visibility: track top query set weekly and expand coverage.

## Guardrails

- No D7 retention decline above 8% for content-assisted cohorts.
- No complaint/dispute increase above 20%.
- No bounce increase above 15% on modified entry pages.
- No overclaim or trust-language violations in shipped copy.

## Execution Lanes

### Lane 1: Content Production and Refresh

Objective: build and compound topical authority.

Weekly actions:
- Publish 1 major high-intent asset and 2 support assets.
- Optimize intros and headings for answer-first and query structure.

- Run 14/30/90-day refresh for existing pages.

Deliverables:
- Updated content queue by persona + funnel + keyword cluster.
- Monthly refresh log with page-level actions and outcomes.

### Lane 2: LLM Citation Readiness

Objective: increase probability of appearing in AI answer engines.

Weekly actions:
- Add quoteable summary block to each priority page.
- Add numbered procedures and compact comparison tables where relevant.
- Ensure claim -> mechanism -> evidence blocks for persuasive sections.
- Run weekly citation snapshot across tracked query list.

Deliverables:
- Citation-readiness checklist per page.
- Monthly report of query coverage gains/losses.

### Lane 3: Off-Site Authority

Objective: increase third-party mentions and referral trust signals.

Weekly actions:
- Reddit engagement: 3-5 high-value interactions across target communities.

- Guest posting: send and track 3 targeted pitches.

Deliverables:
- Authority tracker with owner, cadence, and status.

### Lane 4: Experimentation and Measurement

Objective: improve traffic and conversion with guardrail-safe tests.

Weekly actions:
- Launch 1-2 tests (headline/intro structure, CTA stack, internal link order).
- Use explicit primary KPI + guardrail pair per test.
- Perform midpoint review and end-of-run decision logging.

Deliverables:
- Experiment log entries with outcomes and next decisions.

## Decision Rule for Rollout Escalation

3. Trust and language compliance checks pass.
4. Explicit written approval is recorded.
