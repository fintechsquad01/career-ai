# Growth W1-W2 Messaging Alignment Audit

Owner: Growth + Product  
Branch: `feat/growth-messaging-alignment-w1w2`  
Scope: pricing/paywall and growth-facing message consistency

## Audit Standards

- Canonical brand/entity terms are consistent (`AISkillScore`, `AI-powered career intelligence platform`, `tokens`).
- No overclaims or certainty language for probabilistic outcomes.
- Claim -> mechanism -> evidence appears in persuasive content.
- Outcome/trust framing appears before price framing.
- Shortfall math and token safety language are explicit for monetization copy.

## Findings Checklist

| Area | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lexical consistency | Uses `AISkillScore` and `tokens` consistently | Pass | No off-brand term in sprint artifacts |
| Trust posture | No guaranteed interview/job language | Pass | Drafts remain practical and non-hype |
| Claim integrity | Persuasive sections include mechanism/evidence | Pass | Applied in major and comparison drafts |
| Pricing framing | Outcome/trust precede cost language | Pass | Enforced in pricing support draft |
| Paywall safety | No coercive urgency or hidden-cost framing | Pass | Safety protocol and copy constraints applied |

## Draft-Only Recommendations (No Live Rollout)

1. Add a reusable trust line to monetization surfaces:
   - "No token charge for failed runs. Transparent token math before checkout."
2. Standardize shortfall line everywhere:
   - "You have X tokens, need Y, short by Z."
3. Add capability context next to value anchors:
   - clarify when larger packs are recommended by mission depth.
4. Keep a secondary low-friction CTA on high-intent pages:
   - "Create Account — 15 Free Tokens."

## Release Constraint

All recommendations are documentation-only in this sprint and require explicit approval before any production changes.
