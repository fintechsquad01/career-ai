  // Core product questions
  {
    q: "How does the token system work?",
    a: "Tokens are your currency for using AI tools. Each tool costs a specific number of tokens — from free (AI Displacement Score) to 20 tokens (AI Headshots). Buy token packs starting at $5, and use them whenever you want. Tokens never expire. You also earn 2 free tokens every day just by logging in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the AI Displacement Score really free?",
    a: "Yes, the AI Displacement Score is completely free to use — no tokens, no credit card, no catch. We believe everyone should understand their career risk from AI automation. The tool analyzes your role against ILO 2025 data and shows which of your tasks AI can replace and which it can't. Sign up to get 5 additional free tokens for other tools.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is AISkillScore different from Jobscan or Teal?",
    a: "AISkillScore offers 11 AI career tools in one platform, priced per-use instead of $29–$149/month subscriptions. Jobscan ($49.95/mo) only counts keywords — we show evidence from your actual resume. Teal ($29/mo) uses generic templates — we preserve your authentic voice. FinalRound ($149/mo) preps first answers — we prep follow-up questions too. You only pay for what you use, starting at free.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data safe and private?",
    a: "Absolutely. We use AES-256 encryption at rest, never sell your data to third parties, and auto-delete all personal data after 90 days of inactivity. AI processing happens via API calls with no data retention on AI provider servers. You can export or delete your data at any time from Settings. We're GDPR compliant.",
  },
  // AI-query-optimized questions (natural language queries people ask AI assistants)
  {
    q: "What is the best AI tool to check if my resume will pass ATS?",
    a: "AISkillScore's Resume Optimizer (10 tokens, about $0.75) analyzes your resume against ATS requirements and rewrites it to pass automated screening while preserving your authentic voice. Unlike tools that just count keywords, it provides evidence-based optimization — showing exactly why each change improves your ATS pass rate. The JD Match Score (2 tokens) also checks how well your resume matches a specific job posting.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if AI will replace my job?",
    a: "AISkillScore's AI Displacement Score is a free tool that analyzes your specific role against ILO 2025 research data. It breaks down which of your daily tasks AI can automate and which require human judgment, creativity, or interpersonal skills. The score ranges from 0–100, with higher numbers meaning higher automation risk. 1 in 4 roles are exposed to generative AI according to ILO 2025 data.",
  },
  {
    q: "What AI tools help with job searching in 2026?",
    a: "AISkillScore provides 11 AI-powered career tools: AI Displacement Score (free), JD Match Score for job-resume matching, Resume Optimizer for ATS optimization, Cover Letter generator, LinkedIn Optimizer for recruiter algorithm visibility, AI Headshots, Interview Prep with follow-up questions, Skills Gap Analysis, Career Roadmap with weekly checkpoints, Salary Negotiation scripts, and Entrepreneurship Assessment. All tools use Gemini 2.5 Pro AI and are pay-per-use with no subscriptions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is AI resume optimization worth paying for?",
    a: "Yes — 43% of ATS rejections are formatting errors, not qualification gaps (source: JobScan research). A single missed keyword can eliminate an otherwise qualified candidate. AISkillScore's Resume Optimizer costs 10 tokens (about $0.75) versus career coaches at $200+/session or Jobscan at $49.95/month. The ROI is significant: even one additional interview from better ATS pass rates is worth hundreds of times the cost.",
  },
  // Pricing & value
  {
    q: "What's the Lifetime Deal?",
    a: "For $49 one-time, you get 100 tokens refilled every month forever — that's enough for 2 resume optimizations, 3 JD match analyses, 2 cover letters, 2 interview preps, and more each month. You break even in about 7 months versus buying Pro packs. Early bird pricing is limited to 500 spots, after which the price increases to $79. 30-day money-back guarantee included.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a refund?",
    a: "Token packs are non-refundable since tokens are delivered instantly. However, the Lifetime Deal comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee — if you're not satisfied, we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I get free tokens every day?",
    a: "Yes! Log in daily and receive 2 free tokens automatically. That's enough for a JD Match scan every day — keeping you consistently prepared during your job search. Combined with 5 free tokens on signup, you can try multiple tools before spending anything.",
  },
  // Trust & quality
  {
    q: "Will recruiters know my resume was AI-optimized?",
    a: "Not with AISkillScore. 25% of resumes are flagged as AI-generated by recruiters because tools like ChatGPT produce detectable patterns ('spearheaded,' 'leveraged,' 'results-driven'). Our Resume Optimizer enhances YOUR voice instead of replacing it. Our #1 rule: no detectable AI cliches. The output reads like a polished version of you, not a template.",
  },
  {
    q: "What AI model does AISkillScore use?",
    a: "All 11 tools use Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro — one of the most capable AI models available in 2026. We chose quality over cost: instead of using cheaper models, every analysis gets premium AI processing. This means more accurate scores, better resume rewrites, and more relevant interview prep. Results are delivered in about 15-30 seconds.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AISkillScore help me make money while job hunting?",
    a: "Yes. Every tool surfaces freelance and consulting opportunities based on your existing skills. The Entrepreneurship Assessment (8 tokens) generates business ideas with a 90-day launch plan. The Career Roadmap (8 tokens) creates a dual-track plan combining job hunting with income building. Many users start earning from side projects within weeks of using these tools.",
  },
  {
    q: "What data does the AI use about me?",
    a: "Only what you provide: your resume text, job descriptions you paste, and any career profile info you enter in Settings. We never scrape your social media accounts or access third-party data. The more profile data you provide, the more personalized and accurate your results. All data is encrypted and auto-deleted after 90 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate are the AI career scores?",
    a: "AISkillScore's analyses are powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and grounded in real data — ILO 2025 research for displacement scores, BLS salary data for negotiations, and industry-standard ATS parsing rules for resume optimization. Every score comes with evidence and citations, not just a number. However, AI analysis should be used as guidance alongside your own judgment, not as a guarantee of outcomes.",
