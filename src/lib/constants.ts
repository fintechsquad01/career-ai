    q: "How does the token system work?",

  },
  {
    q: "Is the AI Displacement Score really free?",
    a: "Yes! The AI Displacement Score is completely free to use. We want everyone to understand their career risk. Sign up to get 5 additional free tokens for other tools.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from Jobscan or Teal?",
    a: "We offer 11 AI tools in one platform, priced per-use instead of $29-$149/month subscriptions. You only pay for what you use, and our tools go beyond just resume scanning.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data safe?",
    a: "Absolutely. We use AES-256 encryption at rest, never sell your data, and auto-delete after 90 days. AI processing happens via API with no data retention.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the Lifetime Deal?",
    a: "For $49 one-time, you get 100 tokens refilled every month forever. That covers multiple full job applications each month. Early bird pricing is limited.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a refund?",
    a: "Token packs are non-refundable, but the Lifetime Deal comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, we'll refund you in full.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I get free tokens every day?",
    a: "Yes! Log in daily and receive 2 free tokens. That's enough for a JD Match scan every day. Consistency wins the job hunt.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will recruiters know my resume was AI-optimized?",
    a: "Not with AISkillScore. Unlike other tools that rewrite your resume into generic 'spearheaded' language, we enhance YOUR voice. Our #1 rule: no detectable AI cliches.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the Lifetime Deal different from token packs?",
    a: "Token packs are one-time purchases. The Lifetime Deal ($49) refills 100 tokens every month forever, with a 300 token cap. Need more in a busy month? Top up with any pack.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AISkillScore help me make money while job hunting?",
    a: "Yes. Every tool surfaces freelance and consulting opportunities based on your skills. The Entrepreneurship Assessment and Career Roadmap include income-building plans you can start this week.",
  },
  {
    q: "What data does the AI use about me?",
    a: "Only what you provide: your resume text, job descriptions you paste, and any career profile info you enter. We never scrape your accounts, and we auto-delete data after 90 days.",
