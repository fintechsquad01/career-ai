## Brand North Star

AISkillScore is an AI-powered career intelligence platform for mid-career professionals that turns uncertain job search decisions into evidence-backed action, helping users become the top candidate while building income resilience.

- Category: AI-powered career intelligence platform
- Audience: Mid-career professionals (career transition, job search, resilience-building)
- Core tension: Users need AI help but do not want generic, trust-eroding output
- Desired outcome: Clear next actions, measurable progress, and defensible results

## Positioning and UVP Hierarchy

### Master Promise

Stop guessing. Know exactly where you stand.

### Strategic Positioning

Evidence-first career intelligence that preserves the user's voice and converts analysis into an actionable mission.

### Proof Promise (Platform Level)

- We do not hallucinate: outputs are grounded in user-provided inputs.
- We preserve voice: optimize and enhance, do not rewrite into generic AI cliches.
- We operate as a utility: each run improves future outputs through progressive context.
- We support dual-track outcomes: top-candidate execution plus income-building opportunities.

### Feature-Level Promise

- Input-first analysis: fast, clear analysis from resume, JD, or job URL.
- Mission-driven execution: Job Mission Control gives the next best sequence of actions.
- Competitive value model: per-use tokens with clear pricing and no mandatory subscription.
- Source-aware confidence: claims and recommendations carry evidence and verification context.

## Pillar Messaging

### Pillar 1: Evidence Over Hype

- What we say: Honest assessments with evidence, reasoning, and explicit limitations.
- What we avoid: Inflated certainty, fear-mongering, or unsupported performance claims.
- Proof hooks:
  - "Never hallucinate" rule
  - Source verification panel patterns
  - Evidence-based JD matching and recruiter-perspective framing

### Pillar 2: Voice Preserved, Not Rewritten

- What we say: Optimize for ATS and recruiters without erasing authentic voice.
- What we avoid: Template sameness, robotic phrasing, "one-click rewrite" positioning.
- Proof hooks:
  - Competitor gap: rewriting destroys voice
  - Enhancement framing in tool descriptions and paywall comparisons

### Pillar 3: Mission, Not One-Off Outputs

- What we say: Job Mission Control guides preparation, application, and negotiation.
- What we avoid: "Single score solves everything" narratives.
- Proof hooks:
  - Mission sequence (resume, cover letter, skills gap, interview, salary)
  - Recommended Next patterns using actual prior results

### Pillar 4: Premium Quality, Fair Value

- What we say: High-quality analysis and execution support at clear, per-use pricing.
- What we avoid: "Cheap AI" positioning or race-to-the-bottom language.
- Proof hooks:
  - Competitor anchoring with capability gaps
  - Token pack rate transparency
  - "No subscriptions required" framing

### Pillar 5: Dual-Track Career Resilience

- What we say: Land the role and build income resilience in parallel.
- What we avoid: Framing value as only job placement.
- Proof hooks:
  - Track A + Track B differentiation
  - Income opportunity sections and monetizable skills outputs

## Claim Framework: Claim -> Mechanism -> Evidence

Every externally visible claim must include all three components.

### Required Pattern

1. Claim: What we assert.
2. Mechanism: How the product produces that outcome.
3. Evidence: Why this claim is credible now (data source, product artifact, or direct output behavior).

### Pass/Fail Rules

- Pass only if all three links are explicit.
- Fail if mechanism is vague ("AI magic", "proprietary secret sauce").
- Fail if evidence is missing, unverifiable, outdated, or circular.
- Fail if claim overreaches beyond available evidence.
- Fail if claim implies certainty where outcome is probabilistic.

### Approved Examples

1. Claim: "We give a more reliable match than keyword-only scanners."
   - Mechanism: "We map resume text and JD text semantically, then show recruiter-perspective gap reasoning."
   - Evidence: "Tool output includes evidence-backed match rationale and explicit gap breakdown."

2. Claim: "We preserve your voice while optimizing."
   - Mechanism: "Optimization guidance enhances user-provided language rather than rewriting from scratch."
   - Evidence: "Differentiation language and output standards explicitly ban generic AI cliches."

3. Claim: "You get fair-value pricing versus subscriptions."
   - Mechanism: "Per-use token model with transparent tool costs and pack rates."
   - Evidence: "Published token economy and competitor anchors in pricing flows."

### Not Allowed

- "Guaranteed interview results."
- "Best AI career platform in the world."
- "Scientifically proven to get you hired."
- Any numeric claim without source and date.

## Lexical Map

Use this table for canonical terminology.

| Concept | Canonical Term | Use | Avoid | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Brand name | AISkillScore | All external mentions | AI Skill Score, AiSkillScore | Must match SEO entity consistency |
| Category | AI-powered career intelligence platform | Product descriptions, SEO summaries | Resume tool, career chatbot | Keep category stable across channels |
| Core currency | tokens | Product UI, pricing, onboarding, paywall | credits, points | User-facing default is always "tokens" |
| Daily allotment | daily free tokens | User-facing habit messaging | daily credits (user-facing) | Internal implementation may use `daily_credits` naming |
| Workflow | Job Mission Control | Mission copy and nav context | pipeline, funnel engine | Keep mission language stable |
| Analysis stance | evidence-based analysis | Tool intros, result framing | instant magic score | Pair with mechanisms and evidence |
| Voice benefit | voice-preserved optimization | Resume/cover letter/linkedin messaging | AI rewrite, auto-rewrite | "Enhance, do not replace" framing |
| Competitive framing | fair-value alternative | Pricing comparisons | cheap, dirt cheap, bargain | Premium quality + fair value |
| Input model | input-first | Landing and tool entry | one-click autopilot | Ask for missing context before run |
| Trust posture | honest, non-hallucinatory, non-fear-mongering | Risk and outcomes copy | certainty theater, doom framing | Must align with principles |

## Tone and Banned Phrasing Rules

### Tone Profile

- Clear, direct, and grounded.
- Expert but not academic.
- Confident without overclaiming.
- Motivating without fear pressure.
- Practical and action-oriented.

### Sentence-Level Rules

- Prefer concrete nouns and verbs over adjectives.
- Lead with answer-first statements, then support.
- Use short factual sentences before strategic interpretation.
- Distinguish "assessment" from "guarantee."
- If quoting stats, include source context when space allows.

### Banned Phrasing

Do not use these in brand copy:

- "Guaranteed results"
- "Land any job"
- "100% ATS proof"
- "Secret formula"
- "AI does it all for you"
- "Cheap AI career hacks"
- Empty filler cliches such as:
  - "results-driven team player"
  - "synergize"
  - "leverage" (when used as vague jargon)

### Rewrite Patterns

- Bad: "Our AI guarantees interviews."
  - Good: "Our analysis shows where your application is strongest and where it needs work."
- Bad: "We rewrite your resume perfectly."
  - Good: "We optimize your resume for ATS and recruiters while preserving your voice."
- Bad: "Cheaper than everyone else."
  - Good: "Premium-quality guidance at fair, transparent per-use pricing."

## Premium Quality and Fair Value Guardrails

### Positioning Rules

- Price is a value proof, not the only value proposition.
- Always pair price comparisons with capability differences.
- Anchor to outcomes and quality before cost.
- Use "fair value", "transparent pricing", and "fraction of subscription cost" over "cheap."

### Allowed Language Patterns

- "Premium-quality analysis at fair, per-use pricing."
- "No subscription required. Pay only for what you use."
- "Compared to [competitor], we add [specific capability] at a lower effective cost."
- "Built for quality and accessibility, not inflated monthly lock-in."

### Disallowed Language Patterns

- "Budget tool"
- "Cheapest option"
- "Low-cost AI hack"
- "Same thing, lower price" (without mechanism and evidence)

### Competitive Comparison Format

Use this structure:

1. Competitor baseline (price + known strength).
2. Critical gap (specific missing capability).
3. AISkillScore mechanism advantage.
4. Fair-value close (token price or rate).

## Copy Dispute Protocol

Use this protocol to resolve disputes from this file alone.

1. Classify the disputed sentence:
   - Positioning
   - Claim
   - Lexical choice
   - Tone
   - Pricing/value language
2. Apply source precedence (top to bottom) and choose the highest-precedence compatible phrasing.
3. Validate with the claim framework (`claim -> mechanism -> evidence`).
4. Validate lexical compliance (canonical terms only).
5. Validate tone and premium/fair-value guardrails.
6. Ship the winning variant and record the rejected rationale.

If two variants both pass, choose the one with:

1. Higher evidentiary clarity
2. Lower ambiguity
3. Stronger alignment to "input-first + utility + voice-preserved" positioning

## Dispute Resolution Tests (Acceptance)

### Test 1: Tokens vs Credits

- Variant A: "Get 2 free credits daily."
- Variant B: "Get 2 daily free tokens."
- Ruling: Variant B wins (canonical user-facing lexical map).

### Test 2: Price-Only Claim

- Variant A: "Cheapest AI job tool."
- Variant B: "Premium-quality guidance at fair, transparent per-use pricing."
- Ruling: Variant B wins (premium/fair-value guardrails).

### Test 3: Overclaim

- Variant A: "Guaranteed interview callbacks."
- Variant B: "Evidence-backed analysis to improve your odds and fix high-impact gaps."
- Ruling: Variant B wins (claim framework and no-guarantee policy).

### Test 4: Voice Positioning

- Variant A: "Instant AI rewrite."
- Variant B: "Optimize your resume while preserving your authentic voice."
- Ruling: Variant B wins (pillar and tone alignment).

### Test 5: Mission Framing

- Variant A: "Run one score and you are done."
- Variant B: "Use Job Mission Control to execute the next best actions from analysis to offer."
- Ruling: Variant B wins (mission + utility positioning).

## Contradiction Check Appendix

| Non-Negotiable | Required Wording Constraint | Failure Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Never hallucinate | Do not claim invented facts, employers, metrics, or guarantees | Any unverifiable or fabricated statement |
| Progressive value | Copy should reflect compounding context and repeated utility | One-off, stateless messaging |
| Utility, not a tool | Emphasize repeat workflow and mission progression | Single-output framing as total solution |
| Input-first UX | Start with user input and context sufficiency | Autopilot claims without user context |
| 2026 context | Use current ATS/AI hiring reality framing | Outdated keyword-only framing |
| Token language | Use "tokens" in user-facing copy | "credits" or "points" in user-facing contexts |
| Entity consistency | Use "AISkillScore" and canonical category/tagline | Inconsistent naming or altered category line |
| Premium/fair value | Compare value with capability, not price alone | "cheap/bargain" language or unsupported parity claims |
