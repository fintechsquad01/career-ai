### Expected Tool Usage
| Tool | Priority | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| AI Displacement | Critical | Primary anxiety about AI disrupting creative work |
| LinkedIn Optimizer | Critical | Recruiters are his primary job discovery channel |
| Career Roadmap | High | Wants a strategic plan for agency-to-brand transition |
| Entrepreneurship Assessment | High | Considering starting own consultancy as alternative |

### Test Focus
Does the platform handle creative industry careers effectively? Does the AI Displacement tool give nuanced analysis (creative direction is different from junior design work in terms of AI risk)? Does the LinkedIn Optimizer understand how creative professionals position themselves differently? Does the Entrepreneurship Assessment provide realistic guidance for a creative consultancy?
