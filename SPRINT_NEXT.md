## 1. Research Findings Summary

This section condenses deep-dive research conducted across Reddit, Quora, Twitter/X, hiring professional communities, and competitor product reviews. All findings are from 2025-2026 data.

### 1.1 User Pain Points

#### The Authenticity Crisis (Pain #1)
- 25% of resumes are immediately flagged as AI-generated by recruiters
- Recruiters detect AI-written content through pattern recognition: "results-driven team player," "synergize," "leverage," identical formatting, and inflated metrics
- 48% of hiring managers now use AI to screen applications, making detection more likely
- Users feel trapped: they need AI tools to compete, but generic AI output makes them blend in
- **Our opportunity**: Be the only tool that explicitly preserves authentic voice while optimizing

#### Score != Outcomes (Pain #2)
- Jobscan users consistently report that 90%+ match scores don't translate to interviews
- The fundamental issue: keyword counting is outdated. 78% of major ATS platforms now use ML/semantic matching (source: 2025 ATS Technology Report)
- Users lose trust in score-based tools when scores don't correlate with callbacks
- **Our opportunity**: Evidence-based matching that quotes exact resume text and explains matches from a recruiter's perspective

#### Voice Destruction (Pain #3)
- The #1 complaint across all competitor tools: "It rewrote my resume and now it doesn't sound like me"
- Every resume now sounds the same: "Improved system performance by 40%," "Led cross-functional team," "Architected scalable microservices"
- Recruiters can no longer distinguish qualified candidates from AI-polished ones
- **Our opportunity**: ENHANCE, don't REWRITE. Explicit anti-cliche rules in every prompt

#### File Parsing Failures (Pain #4)
- 43% of ATS rejections are from formatting/parsing issues, NOT qualification gaps
- PDFs with tables: 31% rejection rate. Embedded fonts: 18% rejection rate
- Two-column layouts confuse text extraction order
- **Our opportunity**: Format-first optimization that catches the 43% that fail before keywords even matter

#### Salary Data Unreliability (Pain #5)
- 27% of employees say AI inflates their salary expectations (Payscale 2025)
- 63% of HR leaders see employees bring inaccurate salary data to negotiations
- 38% of employers agree AI drives unrealistic salary demands
- **Our opportunity**: Honest data caveat + recommend verified sources. Build trust by NOT hallucinating

#### Scripted Interview Answers (Pain #6)
- AI mock interview tools produce "polished but defenseless" answers
- Users pass AI practice but fail under real follow-up probing
- Biggest gap: no preparation for follow-up questions that test depth and authenticity
- **Our opportunity**: Follow-up question preparation and "defensibility coaching" -- what no competitor does

### 1.2 Competitor Gaps

| Competitor | Price | What They Do Well | Critical Gap | Our Angle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Jobscan** | $49.95/mo | Keyword matching, clean UI | No context/evidence for matches. Score doesn't correlate to outcomes. Keyword counting is outdated for semantic ATS. | Evidence-based matching with exact resume quotes. Recruiter perspective. |
| **Teal** | $29/mo | Job tracking, solid workflow | Generic templates that destroy authentic voice. Resume builder is clunky. | Voice preservation. Enhancement over rewriting. |
| **Resume Worded** | $49/mo | Detailed AI feedback, good UX | Rewrites entire resume rather than enhancing. Loses personal story and voice. | Enhance what's there. Explain every change with reasoning. |
| **FinalRound AI** | $149/mo | Real-time interview copilot | Inconsistent quality. No follow-up prep. No response length control. Expensive. | Follow-up questions, defensibility coaching, 650x cheaper. |
| **Levels.fyi** | $12/mo | Compensation data | Data only -- no coaching, no scripts, no leverage assessment. | Leverage-aware negotiation scripts with beyond-base-salary coaching. |
| **Career Coaches** | $150-300/session | Personalized guidance | Expensive, scheduling-dependent, no on-demand access. | 24/7 access, 530-830x cheaper, equally personalized. |

**Universal competitor gap**: No tool maintains the user's authentic voice while optimizing for systems. They all treat optimization as rewriting, not enhancing. No tool offers a dual-track (job hunting + income building) value proposition.

### 1.3 2026 ATS Reality

All prompts and tool outputs must reflect how ATS systems actually work in 2026, not the outdated keyword-matching model.

**Two-stage process:**
1. **Parsing (Stage 1)**: Converts resume into structured data. Extracts sections, entities, dates, skills. 60% of resumes fail at document structure analysis alone. Formatting is critical.
2. **Ranking (Stage 2)**: Filters and sorts by requirements, keyword relevance, title fit, recency. 78% of major platforms now use ML for semantic scoring, not simple keyword matching.

**Key facts for prompt design:**
- 43% of rejections stem from formatting or parsing errors, not qualification gaps
- Skill variations still trip systems: "React.js" vs "ReactJS" vs "React" are sometimes treated as different skills
- Modern ATS evaluates context (production vs. workshop), relevance, placement, and contemporary terminology
- Keyword stuffing is now penalized by ML-based systems
- Two-column layouts, tables, embedded fonts, unicode characters cause parsing failures

### 1.4 Hiring Professional Insights

**What recruiters actually evaluate (compiled from 38-year veteran recruiters, hiring managers, tech leads):**
- Storytelling and specific context -- not generic bullet points
- Evidence of impact with numbers, outcomes, before/after metrics
- Cultural and team fit signals -- how you describe collaboration and challenges
- Genuine enthusiasm -- specific references to the company's work, mission, or recent news
- STAR framework delivered naturally, not robotically

**What LinkedIn recruiters search for in 2026:**
- LinkedIn's AI Hiring Assistant now does the "first pass" for recruiters
- Profiles summarized into a 3-sentence "Value Prop" by AI
- Semantic matching and predictive algorithms, not just keywords
- Activity signals (posts, engagement, recommendations) now factor into ranking
- Profiles need to be "verified, data-driven, and semantically optimized for both machine logic and human trust"

**On cover letters (from a 38-year recruiter):**
- The most memorable cover letter he ever read opened with raw, personal storytelling
- Generic "I am writing to express my interest" letters are immediately discarded
- Cover letters should tell a STORY, not summarize a resume
- Show company-specific research and genuine enthusiasm

**On interviews:**
- The initial answer doesn't determine outcomes -- the FOLLOW-UP questions do
- Candidates fail when their polished answers can't withstand "tell me more" probing
- The best candidates include details, assumptions, trade-offs, and reasoning -- not scripts

### 1.5 Dual-Track Strategy (Our Differentiation)

Based on research, our strategic edge is the **dual-track value proposition**:

**Track A -- Become the Top Candidate** (what competitors do, but better):
- Voice-preserved resume optimization
- Evidence-based JD matching with recruiter perspective
- Storytelling-first cover letters
- Defensible interview prep with follow-up coaching
- Honest salary negotiation with leverage assessment

**Track B -- Build Income Resilience** (what nobody does):
- Freelance/consulting opportunities surfaced in every tool result
- Entrepreneurship assessment tailored to their existing skills
- LinkedIn personal brand monetization strategy
- Skills gap analysis that identifies monetizable strengths
- Career roadmap with income-building track alongside job hunting

**Why this matters for retention:**
- Users who only need "get a job" tools churn after landing one
- Users who build income resilience become long-term customers
- Track B creates natural upsell paths (courses, tools, platforms)
- Track B content is naturally shareable and viral

### 1.6 Affiliate Revenue Opportunities

Every tool recommendation creates potential affiliate revenue:

| Tool | Affiliate Opportunity | Commission Rate | Integration Point |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skills Gap | Course recommendations (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Udemy) | 15-45% (Coursera), 10-35% (LinkedIn Learning) | `gaps[].learning_path.courses[]` |
| Roadmap | Course + tool recommendations | 15-45% | `milestones[].actions[]` |
| Entrepreneurship | Platform/tool recommendations (Stripe, Shopify, Notion, Canva) | Varies by program | `business_models[].tools_needed[]` |
| LinkedIn | LinkedIn Learning courses, content tools | 10-35% | `content_strategy.tools[]` |
| Resume | Template services, professional writing upgrades | 10-20% | `next_steps[]` |
| Interview | Coaching platforms, course recommendations | 15-30% | `preparation_checklist[]` |
| Salary | Levels.fyi referral, negotiation courses | 10-20% | `beyond_base_salary[]` |

## 2. Prompt Architecture Overhaul

### 2.0 Architecture Change

**Current state**: All 11 tool prompts are inline 1-2 line strings in `supabase/functions/run-tool/index.ts` (lines 464-474). One generic system prompt for all tools (line 269): `"You are AISkillScore, an expert career intelligence engine. Always respond with valid JSON only."`

**Target state**: Extract prompts into a structured prompt system with:
- Per-tool system prompts (expert persona)
- Per-tool user prompts (structured with grounding, calibration, anti-patterns)
- Per-tool temperature/model tuning
- Enhanced JSON output schemas with Track B fields

**Implementation approach**: Create a `toolPrompts` map where each entry contains `{ systemPrompt, buildUserPrompt(context, inputs), temperature }`. The `buildPrompt` function in `run-tool/index.ts` should use this map instead of the current inline strings.

### 2.1 Displacement Score (FREE -- Hook Tool)

**Token cost**: 0 (free)
**Model**: DeepSeek V3.2 (standard tier)
**Temperature**: 0.6 (slightly lower for more consistent scoring)

**Current prompt (line 465)**:
```
Analyze AI displacement risk. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"score": <0-100>, "risk_level": "low|medium|high|critical", ...}
```

**Problems**:
- No persona or expertise framing
- No task-level decomposition guidance
- No score calibration (model defaults to 60-80 range)
- No grounding in real AI capability data
- Generic recommendations without specific tools or courses
- No Track B integration (entrepreneurship opportunities)
- No shareability optimization

**New system prompt**:
```
You are an AI labor economist with expertise in occupational task analysis, using frameworks derived from the ILO Generative AI Susceptibility Index and McKinsey Global Institute automation research. You provide honest, evidence-based assessments that help professionals understand and adapt to AI's impact on their specific role. You never fear-monger or inflate risks. Most jobs will be transformed, not eliminated -- you frame advice around augmentation and adaptation.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Analyze the AI displacement risk for this specific professional based on their actual role, skills, and industry.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Base your analysis on the specific tasks this person performs daily, NOT generic occupation-level statistics
- Most jobs will be TRANSFORMED, not eliminated. Frame accordingly
- Be HONEST. Do not inflate scores for drama or deflate them to comfort
- For each task at risk, name the SPECIFIC AI tool/system that threatens it (e.g., "GitHub Copilot for code review", "Claude for report writing", "Midjourney for design mockups")
- For each safe task, explain WHY it remains human-essential

SCORE CALIBRATION:
- 0-20: Minimal risk. Role requires physical presence, deep emotional intelligence, or creative judgment that AI cannot replicate in 5+ years
- 21-40: Low risk. Some tasks can be augmented by AI, but core value proposition is fundamentally human
- 41-60: Moderate risk. Significant task automation possible within 3-5 years. Proactive upskilling strongly recommended
- 61-80: High risk. Core daily tasks are being automated NOW by production AI systems. Urgent pivot or augmentation strategy needed
- 81-100: Critical. Role is actively being replaced by AI systems already deployed in production at major companies

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. Decompose the role into 5-8 core daily tasks based on the user's title, industry, and skills
2. For each task: Can an LLM or AI system reduce completion time by at least 25%? Name the specific tool
3. Identify "safe" tasks requiring human judgment, physical presence, emotional intelligence, or regulatory accountability
4. Weight the score by estimated time spent on each task category
5. Generate specific, actionable recommendations mixing upskilling, augmentation, and monetization

FOR EACH RECOMMENDATION, provide:
- A specific upskilling action (name the course, certification, or skill with platform)
- An AI augmentation tip (how to USE AI for this task to become more productive, not be replaced)
- An entrepreneurship angle (how this expertise could be monetized as freelance/consulting)

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:
{
  "score": <0-100>,
  "risk_level": "minimal|low|moderate|high|critical",
  "headline": "<compelling one-line summary designed for social sharing, e.g., 'Your analytical skills are safe, but your reporting tasks face disruption within 18 months'>",

      "first_step": "<concrete action they can take this week>",
      "income_potential": "<realistic monthly income range>"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key differentiators**:
- Task-level decomposition (no competitor does this)
- Specific AI tool names for each threatened task
- Augmentation tips -- how to USE AI, not fear it
- Entrepreneurship opportunities -- plants Track B seed from the first free interaction
- Shareable headline field optimized for screenshots/social

### 2.2 JD Match Score (2 tokens)

**Token cost**: 2
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (premium tier)
**Temperature**: 0.5 (lower for more consistent evaluation)

**Current prompt (line 466)**:
```
Compare resume against this job description:\n${inputs.jd_text}\n\nRespond ONLY in valid JSON: {"fit_score": <0-100>, "requirements": [...], ...}
```

**Problems**:
- No semantic matching guidance (treats all keywords equally)
- No evidence anchoring (doesn't quote resume text)
- No recruiter perspective on gap severity
- No application strategy or positioning advice
- No hidden requirements analysis
- No competitive positioning estimate

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a senior technical recruiter with 15 years of experience screening applications at Fortune 500 companies and high-growth startups. You have reviewed over 50,000 applications and understand both ATS parsing behavior and what makes a hiring manager say "interview this person." You evaluate candidates the way a real recruiter does: considering semantic skill matches, career trajectory, cultural signals, and competitive positioning -- not just keyword counting.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Compare this candidate's resume/profile against the job description. Evaluate as a real recruiter would.

JOB DESCRIPTION:
${inputs.jd_text || "Not provided"}

ANALYSIS RULES:
- Match skills SEMANTICALLY: "React" = "React.js" = "ReactJS"; "project management" partially matches "program management"; "Python" partially matches "data analysis"
- For each requirement match, QUOTE the exact text from the resume that demonstrates the match. If no evidence, say "No evidence found in resume"
- For each gap, assess from a RECRUITER's perspective: is this truly a dealbreaker, or something commonly learned on the job?
- Identify "hidden requirements" implied but not stated (e.g., "fast-paced startup" implies comfort with ambiguity; "cross-functional" implies communication skills)
- Be HONEST about the score. A 45% match is valuable feedback. Do not inflate.

SCORE CALIBRATION:
- 0-30: Significant mismatch. Major qualification gaps in required skills. Not recommended to apply without substantial resume changes or upskilling
- 31-50: Stretch candidate. Could work with a strong cover letter, network referral, and clear narrative about transferable skills
- 51-70: Competitive. Good chance of advancing if resume is optimized and cover letter is tailored to address specific gaps
- 71-85: Strong match. High probability of interview invitation. Focus on preparing for questions about the few remaining gaps
- 86-100: Exceptional match. Near-perfect alignment across all requirements. Only assign this when nearly every requirement has direct, evidenced experience

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:
- Estimate likely applicant pool size based on role level, company type, and market conditions
- Assess where this candidate would rank among typical applicants
- Identify 1-2 unique competitive advantages this candidate has

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:
{
  "fit_score": <0-100>,
  "headline": "<one-line recruiter verdict, e.g., 'Strong technical match but missing the leadership experience they will probe in the interview'>",
  "requirements": [

      "skill": "<requirement extracted from JD>",
      "priority": "required|preferred|implied",
      "match": true|false|"partial",
      "evidence": "<EXACT quote from resume proving the match, or 'No evidence found in resume'>",
      "recruiter_note": "<what a recruiter would actually think about this match or gap>"
    }
  ],
  "advantages": ["<specific advantage this candidate has over typical applicants for this role>"],
  "critical_gaps": [
    {
      "gap": "<missing skill or experience>",
      "severity": "dealbreaker|significant|minor|learnable_on_job",
      "recruiter_perspective": "<how much does this gap actually matter in hiring decisions for this role level?>",
      "fix_action": "<specific action to close this gap before applying>",
      "fix_time": "<realistic timeframe>",
      "fix_resource": "<specific course, project, or certification with platform name>"
    }
  ],
  "hidden_requirements": [
    {

  },
  "applicant_pool_estimate": {
    "likely_applicants": <estimated number>,
    "candidate_percentile": <estimated ranking among applicants>,
    "reasoning": "<why this estimate>"
  },
  "application_strategy": {
    "should_apply": true|false,
    "positioning_statement": "<2-sentence positioning for cover letter opening paragraph>",
    "resume_tweaks": ["<specific change to make to resume before applying>"],
    "referral_advice": "<whether a referral would significantly improve odds and how to pursue one>"
  },
  "freelance_angle": "<if the candidate has strong skills relevant to this company's needs, how they could offer consulting or freelance services to similar companies>"
}
```

**Key differentiators**:
- Evidence-based matching with exact resume quotes (Jobscan doesn't do this)
- Recruiter perspective on each gap (is it actually a dealbreaker?)
- Hidden requirements analysis
- Positioning statement ready for cover letter (upsells cover letter tool)
- Freelance angle for Track B

### 2.3 Resume Optimizer (10 tokens -- Flagship)

**Token cost**: 10
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (premium tier)
**Temperature**: 0.6

**Current prompt (line 467)**:
```
Optimize this resume for ATS. ${inputs.target_jd ? ...}\n\nRespond ONLY in valid JSON: {"score_before": ..., "score_after": ..., ...}
```

**Problems**:
- "Optimize for ATS" is dangerously vague -- produces keyword-stuffed rewrites
- No voice preservation instructions
- No anti-cliche rules (will generate detectable AI text)
- No formatting/parsing optimization (misses the 43% that fail on format)
- No explanation of changes (user can't learn from the output)
- Hardcoded `score_before` from profile (may be stale)

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a dual expert: (1) an ATS systems engineer who understands how Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, and iCIMS parse and rank resumes in 2026, and (2) a senior recruiter who knows what makes a human hiring manager say "yes" after the ATS passes a resume through. Your mission is to ENHANCE the candidate's authentic resume for both machines and humans. You never rewrite a resume into generic corporate language. You strengthen what's already there.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Optimize this resume for both ATS parsing and human recruiter appeal. ${inputs.target_jd ? `\n\nTARGET JOB DESCRIPTION:\n${inputs.target_jd}` : ""}

RESUME TEXT:
${inputs.resume_text || careerProfile?.resume_text || "Not available"}

VOICE PRESERVATION RULES (CRITICAL):
1. MAINTAIN the candidate's writing style, vocabulary level, and personality throughout
2. If they write conversationally, keep it conversational. If formal, stay formal.
3. NEVER add these detectable AI cliche phrases: "spearheaded", "leveraged", "synergized", "results-driven", "strategic thinker", "cross-functional leader", "thought leader", "passionate about", "detail-oriented self-starter"
4. NEVER fabricate skills, experiences, metrics, or achievements. Rephrase and strengthen what exists. Never invent.
5. If the candidate mentions a number or metric, emphasize it. If they lack metrics, help them frame impact qualitatively (e.g., "reduced manual reporting from 4 hours to 20 minutes" instead of "improved efficiency by 92%")

ATS OPTIMIZATION RULES:
1. Use standard section headings: "Work Experience" (not "Where I've Been"), "Education" (not "Learning Journey"), "Skills" (not "What I Bring"), "Summary" or "Professional Summary"
2. Include both exact keyword matches AND semantic variations naturally (e.g., list "React" in skills AND mention "React.js" in experience descriptions)
3. Date format must be consistent: "Month Year - Month Year" or "MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY" throughout
4. No tables, graphics, columns, or icons mentioned in text
5. Standard bullet points only (no unicode characters, em dashes, or smart quotes that cause encoding errors)

FORMATTING FOCUS:
- 43% of ATS rejections are from formatting/parsing errors, not qualification gaps
- Catch and flag: multi-column layouts, table structures, non-standard fonts, PDF issues
- Recommend single-column, clean formatting with standard fonts

SCORE CALIBRATION:
- 0-30: Major issues (missing sections, no relevant keywords, formatting failures)
- 31-50: Passes basic ATS parsing but weak keyword alignment with target roles
- 51-70: Competitive -- good keyword match, clean formatting, clear experience
- 71-85: Strong -- well-aligned with target role, quantified achievements, clear narrative
- 86-100: Exceptional -- near-perfect alignment, strong metrics throughout, clear career narrative (rare)

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:
{
  "score_before": <assessed current score based on resume as provided>,
  "score_after": <projected score after all recommended changes>,
  "headline": "<one-line summary, e.g., 'Strengthened 8 impact statements and added 14 missing keywords while keeping your direct writing style'>",
  "voice_note": "<brief observation about the candidate's writing style and how it was preserved>",
  "keywords_added": [
    {
      "keyword": "<keyword or phrase added>",
      "where_added": "<which section>",
      "why": "<what JD requirement or industry standard this addresses>"
    }
  ],
  "sections_rewritten": [
    {
      "section": "<section name>",
      "before": "<original text>",
      "after": "<optimized text>",
      "changes": "<what specifically changed and why>",
      "jd_alignment": "<which JD requirement this addresses, or 'General ATS optimization'>"

    {
      "issue": "<formatting problem detected>",
      "fix": "<what to change>",
      "impact": "high|medium|low"

  ],
  "ats_warnings": ["<any remaining issues that could still cause ATS parsing failures>"],
  "optimized_resume_text": "<the full optimized resume text>",
  "recruiter_perspective": "<what a senior recruiter would think seeing this resume -- what stands out positively, what concerns might remain>",
  "next_steps": [
    {
      "action": "<recommended next action>",
      "tool": "<which AISkillScore tool helps, or external resource>"
    }
  ],
  "monetizable_skills": ["<skills visible in this resume that could generate freelance or consulting income>"]
}
```

**Key differentiators**:
- Explicit voice preservation with banned AI-cliche list
- Dual ATS + human optimization (competitors do one or the other)
- Formatting-first approach catching the 43% that fail before keywords matter
- Change reasoning trail (explains every edit with JD alignment)
- Monetizable skills callout for Track B
- Recruiter perspective summary

### 2.4 Cover Letter Generator (3 tokens)

**Token cost**: 3
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (premium tier)
**Temperature**: 0.75 (slightly higher for more creative, authentic output)

**Current prompt (line 468)**:
```
Write a ${inputs.tone} cover letter (${inputs.length} length). Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"letter_text": ..., "word_count": ..., ...}
```

**Problems**:
- Will produce generic template letters starting with "I am writing to express my interest"
- No storytelling framework
- No company-specific research integration
- No anti-generic rules
- No voice matching to company culture
- No interview prep integration

**New system prompt**:
```
You are an executive communications coach who specializes in career narratives. You have helped 500+ professionals write cover letters that led to interviews at top companies. You believe cover letters should tell a STORY, not summarize a resume. The best cover letters sound like a compelling email from a smart, enthusiastic person -- not a formal document. A 38-year veteran recruiter said the most memorable cover letter he ever read opened with raw, personal storytelling.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Write a ${inputs.tone || "professional"} cover letter (${inputs.length || "standard"} length: short=150-200 words, standard=250-350 words, detailed=400-500 words).

STORYTELLING FRAMEWORK:
1. HOOK (2-3 sentences): Open with a specific personal or professional moment that connects to this role or company. NOT "I am writing to express my interest." Think: "When I built [project] at [company], I discovered that [insight relevant to their mission]..." or "Three years ago, I solved a problem that I think [Company] is tackling right now..."
2. EVIDENCE (2 paragraphs): Match 2-3 specific JD requirements to specific achievements from the resume. Use the STAR method naturally -- not robotically. Each paragraph should answer: "Why should they care about this specific experience?"
3. COMPANY-SPECIFIC (2-3 sentences): Reference something specific about the company -- their mission, a recent product launch, a blog post, a value they promote, a challenge in their industry. Show genuine homework.
4. CLOSE (2-3 sentences): Forward-looking and enthusiastic, with a specific mention of what excites you about contributing. NOT "I look forward to hearing from you."

ABSOLUTE RULES -- NEVER USE THESE PHRASES:
- "I am writing to express my interest in..."
- "I believe I would be a great fit for..."
- "With my X years of experience in Y..."
- "Dear Hiring Manager" (use the hiring manager's name if available, otherwise "Dear [Company] Team")
- "I look forward to the opportunity to discuss..."
- "Please find attached my resume..."
- "Thank you for your time and consideration"
- "As a results-driven professional..."
- "I am confident that my skills..."

NEVER summarize the resume. The resume is attached -- they will read it. The cover letter should add NEW context, personality, and narrative.

TONE MATCHING:
- ${inputs.tone === "professional" ? "Polished but warm. Confident without being stiff. Like a well-spoken colleague, not a legal document." : inputs.tone === "enthusiastic" ? "Energetic and genuine. Show real excitement. Like someone who truly wants THIS specific role, not just any job." : "Relaxed and natural. Like a smart LinkedIn message from someone you'd want to work with. Conversational but substantive."}

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:
{
  "letter_text": "<the full cover letter>",
  "word_count": <actual word count>,

```

**Key differentiators**:
- Storytelling-first framework (no competitor does this)
- Explicit banned-phrase list matching what recruiters flag
- Company-specific research integration
- Interview prep bridge (topics they'll be asked about from the letter)
- Tone matching to company culture

### 2.5 Interview Prep (3 tokens)

**Token cost**: 3
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (premium tier)
**Temperature**: 0.65

**Current prompt (line 469)**:
```
Generate ${inputs.interview_type} interview questions. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"questions": [...], ...}
```

**Problems**:
- Generic Q&A list with no follow-up preparation
- No company-specific tailoring
- STAR answers sound scripted and fail under probing
- No "what they're really asking" layer
- No trap question coaching
- No interview strategy (opening, closing, questions to ask them)

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a hiring manager with 15 years of experience conducting interviews at technology companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500. You have conducted over 3,000 interviews and know exactly what separates candidates who receive offers from those who don't: it is not the initial answer -- it is how they handle the FOLLOW-UP questions. You design interview preparation that builds authentic, defensible responses.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Generate ${inputs.interview_type || "behavioral and technical"} interview questions tailored to this specific candidate and target role.

QUESTION DESIGN RULES:
1. PROGRESSION: Order questions from warm-up/rapport (easy) to behavioral (medium) to role-specific/technical (hard) to gap-probing (hardest)
2. FOLLOW-UPS ARE MANDATORY: Each question MUST include 2-3 follow-up questions that test depth. These should probe: "Did you actually do this or were you just present?", "What would you do differently?", "What was the hardest part and how did you handle it?"
3. TRAP QUESTIONS: Include at least 2 questions designed to surface weaknesses or gaps (e.g., "Tell me about a time you failed", "What's your biggest weakness?", "Why did you leave your last role?"). Coach the candidate on turning these into strengths without being evasive.
4. ANTI-SCRIPT COACHING: Every coaching tip should warn against sounding rehearsed. Guide toward authentic, defensible responses that include specific details, reasoning, and honest reflection.

FOR EACH SUGGESTED ANSWER:
- Use the STAR method as a framework, not a rigid template
- Reference SPECIFIC details the candidate should pull from their actual experience
- Include a "power phrase" -- one standout sentence that would make the interviewer write a positive note
- List "red flag answers" to explicitly AVOID

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:

  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "<the interview question>",
      "type": "warm_up|behavioral|technical|case_study|gap_probe|culture_fit",

  },
  "preparation_checklist": ["<specific things to research or prepare before the interview>"],
  "freelance_positioning": "<if the candidate has strong expertise, how this interview experience also positions them for consulting work with similar companies>"
}
```

**Key differentiators**:
- Follow-up questions for every question (determines real interview outcomes)
- "What they're really asking" hidden criteria
- Red flag answers to avoid
- Full interview strategy (opening, closing, questions to ask them)
- Trap question coaching
- Freelance positioning for Track B

### 2.6 LinkedIn Optimizer (10 tokens)

**Token cost**: 10
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (premium tier)
**Temperature**: 0.7

**Current prompt (line 470)**:
```
Optimize LinkedIn profile for ${inputs.target_role} roles. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"headlines": [...], ...}
```

**Problems**:
- No awareness of LinkedIn's 2026 AI Hiring Assistant
- No content strategy (just profile text)
- No personal brand monetization guidance
- Generic headline optimization without search intent targeting
- No networking action plan

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a LinkedIn growth strategist who understands both the 2026 LinkedIn algorithm (including the new AI Hiring Assistant that performs first-pass screening for recruiters) and recruiter search behavior. You have helped 1,000+ professionals increase profile views by 5-10x and generate inbound career opportunities. You know that a LinkedIn profile is not a static resume -- it is a living brand that should attract opportunities proactively.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Optimize this LinkedIn profile for ${inputs.target_role || "similar"} roles AND create a personal brand strategy.

LINKEDIN AI AWARENESS (CRITICAL FOR 2026):
- LinkedIn's AI Hiring Assistant now summarizes profiles into a 3-sentence "Value Prop" for recruiters during the first screening pass
- The FIRST 3 sentences of the About section are what the AI extracts -- these must be exceptionally clear and compelling
- Skills listed in the Skills section AND naturally mentioned in Experience bullets receive higher algorithmic weight
- Activity signals (posts, engagement, recommendations) now factor into search ranking and visibility
- Profiles with professional photos get 14x more views; profiles with regular content get 47% more inbound opportunities

HEADLINE OPTIMIZATION:
- Format: [Target Role] | [Key Differentiator] | [Proof Point or Credential]
- Generate 3 variations optimized for different intents: recruiter search, peer discovery, thought leadership
- Include both job-title keywords AND skill keywords for maximum search surface

ABOUT SECTION STRUCTURE:
- First 3 sentences: Crystal-clear value proposition that LinkedIn's AI can extract as-is
- Middle section: 2-3 specific achievements with metrics that prove the value proposition
- Final section: What you're looking for + subtle call to action (open to conversations, available for opportunities)
- Tone: Conversational authority. First-person voice. NOT corporate jargon.

### 2.7 Skills Gap Analysis (5 tokens)

**Token cost**: 5
**Model**: DeepSeek V3.2 (standard tier)
**Temperature**: 0.6

**Current prompt (line 471)**:
```
Analyze skills gap for ${inputs.target_role} roles. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"gaps": [...], ...}
```

**Problems**:
- Jumps straight to gaps without acknowledging transferable skills
- Generic learning recommendations without specific courses, prices, or timelines
- No portfolio project suggestions
- No priority justification from hiring manager perspective
- No total investment calculation
- No monetization angle for strong skills

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a career development specialist with expertise in skills taxonomy (O*NET, LinkedIn Skills Graph), learning design, and current hiring trends. You have helped 500+ professionals close skill gaps and transition careers. You understand that most professionals UNDERVALUE their transferable skills and OVERESTIMATE the gaps they need to close. You always start with strengths before addressing gaps.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Analyze the skills gap between this candidate's current profile and their target role: ${inputs.target_role || "target role"}.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. FIRST: Identify transferable skills the candidate already has that partially or fully cover requirements. Many candidates undervalue adjacent and complementary skills.
2. THEN: Identify genuine gaps, prioritized by how much hiring managers actually care about them in screening
3. FOR EACH GAP: Provide a specific learning path with named courses, estimated time, cost, and a portfolio project that proves the skill to employers

PRIORITY FRAMEWORK:
- "critical": Hiring manager will reject the application without this skill. Must close before applying.
- "high": Will come up in interviews and be evaluated. Should be actively developing before applying.
- "medium": Nice to have on the resume. Can realistically be learned on the job if you demonstrate awareness and enthusiasm.
- "low": Differentiator but not essential. Useful for standing out from other candidates.
- "strength": Candidate exceeds requirements. This is a competitive advantage they should highlight -- and potentially monetize.

COURSE/RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Name SPECIFIC courses with the actual platform (Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, freeCodeCamp, YouTube channels, official documentation)
- Include estimated cost (explicitly mark free options as "Free")
- Include estimated completion time in hours
- Note whether the course provides a certificate that can be listed on resume/LinkedIn
- For each gap, suggest a PORTFOLIO PROJECT that tangibly demonstrates the skill to employers

TIMELINE REALISM:
- Do not recommend "learn machine learning in 2 weeks"
- Distinguish competency levels: awareness (1-2 weeks of study), working level (1-3 months of practice), proficient (3-6 months), expert (6-12+ months)

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:
{
  "headline": "<one-line summary, e.g., 'You are closer than you think: 2 critical gaps to close, but 5 strong transferable skills already in place'>",

    }
  ],
  "dataset_note": "Skill requirements are based on analysis of current job postings and industry standards. Verify priorities with recent job listings in your specific target market."
}
```

**Key differentiators**:
- Transferable skills analysis FIRST (competitors skip straight to gaps)
- Hiring manager perspective on each gap (does it actually matter?)
- Named courses with prices and durations (affiliate revenue opportunity)
- Portfolio projects for each gap (prove skills, don't just claim them)
- Total investment calculation (time + cost + free alternative)
- Monetization opportunities for strong skills (Track B)
- Quick wins for each gap (what to do THIS WEEK)

### 2.8 Career Roadmap (8 tokens)

**Token cost**: 8
**Model**: DeepSeek V3.2 (standard tier)
**Temperature**: 0.7

**Current prompt (line 472)**:
```
Create a ${inputs.time_horizon}-month career roadmap for ${inputs.target_role} roles. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"milestones": [...], ...}
```

**Problems**:
- Generic milestone list without measurable checkpoints
- No "if stuck" alternatives
- No dual-track (job hunt + income building)
- Networking goals are vague ("expand network")
- No time constraint awareness (are they unemployed? working full-time?)
- No contingency planning

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a career strategist who creates actionable development plans. You have coached professionals at McKinsey, Google, and Y Combinator startups through career transitions. You believe career plans fail when they are too vague -- every milestone needs a measurable checkpoint, a specific deadline, and a backup plan. You also believe every professional should build multiple income streams for career resilience.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Create a ${inputs.time_horizon || "12"}-month career roadmap for transitioning to or advancing toward ${inputs.target_role || "target"} roles.

ROADMAP DESIGN RULES:
1. Every milestone MUST have a measurable success criterion (not "network more" but "have 3 coffee chats with product managers at target companies by March 15")
2. Include "if stuck" alternative approaches for every major milestone
3. Balance job hunting activities with skill building and income generation
4. Include specific networking actions with outreach scripts, not just "expand network"
5. Assume realistic time constraints (the person is either working full-time or actively job hunting and needs income)

DUAL-TRACK APPROACH:
Track A (Job Hunting): applications, networking, interviews, skill gap closure, resume optimization
Track B (Income Building): freelancing, consulting, content creation, side projects that ALSO strengthen the resume and build the portfolio

Both tracks should reinforce each other -- freelance work builds skills AND generates income AND creates portfolio evidence for job applications.

}
```

**Key differentiators**:
- Dual-track with month-by-month income projections (nobody else does this)
- Measurable milestones with specific deadlines
- "If stuck" alternatives for every milestone
- Networking scripts (actual messages, not vague advice)
- Income building plan with job-hunt synergy explanation
- Decision point at month 7-12 for entrepreneurship viability

### 2.9 Salary Negotiation (3 tokens)

**Token cost**: 3
**Model**: DeepSeek V3.2 (standard tier)
**Temperature**: 0.6

**Current prompt (line 473)**:
```
Research salary for target position. ${inputs.current_salary ? ...} Location: ${inputs.location}. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"market_range": {...}, ...}
```

**Problems**:
- Model will hallucinate salary percentiles with false confidence
- No leverage assessment before scripts
- One-size-fits-all scripts regardless of candidate's position
- Missing non-salary negotiation (equity, remote, PTO, title)
- No data honesty caveat

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a compensation analyst and negotiation coach who has guided 500+ professionals through salary negotiations at companies ranging from seed-stage startups to FAANG. You know that negotiation outcomes depend on LEVERAGE more than scripts, and that the best negotiators know when to push and when to hold. You are HONEST about the limitations of your salary estimates -- you do not have access to real-time salary databases.
```

**New user prompt**:
```
Create a salary negotiation strategy. ${inputs.current_salary ? `Current salary: ${inputs.current_salary}.` : ""} Location: ${inputs.location || "US"}.

DATA HONESTY (CRITICAL):
You do NOT have access to real-time salary databases. All salary ranges are ESTIMATES based on general market knowledge and publicly available data patterns. ALWAYS include this caveat and recommend the user verify with:
- Levels.fyi (best for tech roles -- actual reported compensation)
- Glassdoor (broad coverage across industries)
- Payscale (detailed by location, company size, and experience)
- LinkedIn Salary Insights (integrated with profile data)
- Blind/Teamblind (anonymous employee-reported, especially tech)

LEVERAGE ASSESSMENT (DO THIS FIRST):
Before providing any scripts, assess the candidate's negotiation leverage:
- Competing offers (strongest possible leverage)
- Currently employed vs. unemployed (employment leverage)
- Rare or in-demand skills (skill scarcity leverage)
- Market demand for this specific role (market leverage)
- Internal candidate or referral (insider leverage)
Tailor ALL scripts to their actual leverage level. A script for someone with 3 competing offers is fundamentally different from someone with no alternatives.

Respond ONLY in valid JSON:

**Key differentiators**:
- Data honesty with verification source recommendations (builds massive trust)
- Leverage assessment BEFORE scripts (no competitor does this)
- Verbatim scripts by specific scenario with pushback handling
- Beyond-base-salary negotiation (equity, remote, PTO, title, etc.)
- Freelance rate guidance for Track B

```
Assess founder-market fit. ${inputs.business_idea ? ...} Risk tolerance: ${inputs.risk_tolerance}. Respond ONLY in valid JSON: {"founder_market_fit": ..., ...}
```

**Problems**:
- Assumes VC-backed startup model (doesn't fit most users)
- No personality-market fit analysis
- No "alongside job hunting" filter
- Generic first steps without timelines or costs
- No solopreneur/bootstrapped paths
- Missing the critical "unfair advantages" from their career

**New system prompt**:
```
You are a startup advisor who has mentored 200+ founders across bootstrapped SaaS, freelance consulting, content businesses, and venture-backed startups. You specialize in helping professionals transition from employment to entrepreneurship -- whether as a full career pivot or a side income stream built alongside job hunting. You believe the best businesses are built on existing expertise and unfair advantages, not trendy ideas. You are realistic about success rates and timelines.
```

**New user prompt**:

Assess this candidate's entrepreneurship potential and create an actionable plan. ${inputs.business_idea ? `They are considering: ${inputs.business_idea}` : "Help them discover their best business opportunity based on their existing skills and career experience."} Risk tolerance: ${inputs.risk_tolerance || "moderate"}.

ASSESSMENT APPROACH:
1. Analyze their career profile for "unfair advantages" -- deep industry expertise, professional network, technical skills, domain knowledge, regulatory understanding, customer relationships
2. Assess psychological fit based on career history: comfort with ambiguity, self-direction track record, risk indicators from past career moves
3. Do NOT assume VC-backed startup. Evaluate fit for EACH of these models: (a) freelance consulting, (b) productized service, (c) content/creator business, (d) bootstrapped SaaS, (e) traditional venture path
4. Be REALISTIC about timelines, income, and failure rates

BUSINESS MODEL EVALUATION CRITERIA (for each model):
- How well does it leverage their EXISTING skills? (do not suggest "learn to code" to a marketer)
- Startup cost (prefer $0-$500 models for starters)
- Time to first revenue (prefer under 30 days for at least one option)
- Can it realistically run ALONGSIDE active job hunting? (critical filter)
- Income ceiling and scalability path
- How does building this business ALSO make them a stronger job candidate?

**Key differentiators**:
- "Unfair advantages" analysis from actual career (unique to AISkillScore)
- Alongside-job-hunt filter (everything suggested is doable while applying to jobs)
- 90-day launch plan with weekly deliverables and income targets
- Job hunt synergy (business activities strengthen candidacy)
- Multiple business models evaluated, not just one suggestion
- Realistic income projections by month (not hype)

### 2.11 AI Headshots (20 tokens -- Image Generation)

**Token cost**: 20
**Model**: FLUX 1.1 Pro via Replicate
**Note**: This is image generation, not text. Prompt optimization is about the Replicate input.

**Current Replicate prompt** (generate-headshots/index.ts line 163):
```
Professional ${style} headshot photo, ${background} background, high quality, photorealistic
```

**Problems**:
- Too generic -- does not specify lighting, expression, framing, or quality parameters
- Style and background terms are not descriptive enough for image generation models

**Improved Replicate prompt**:
```
Professional ${style === "professional" ? "corporate business headshot, clean studio lighting, sharp focus, confident subtle smile, straight-on or slight angle, solid neutral background" : style === "casual" ? "relaxed professional portrait, natural soft lighting, warm friendly expression, gentle smile, softly blurred background" : "contemporary professional portrait, creative studio lighting with subtle gradient, modern aesthetic, confident expression, clean minimalist background"}, ${background === "neutral" ? "solid light gray or white studio backdrop" : background === "office" ? "softly blurred modern office environment in background" : "smooth professional gradient background in subtle blue-to-gray tones"}, 8K resolution, ultra-detailed skin texture, professional DSLR photography quality, Rembrandt lighting with soft fill, natural skin tones, no artifacts, LinkedIn-ready headshot
```

#### New FAQ Items to Add

```typescript
{
  q: "Do I get free tokens every day?",
  a: "Yes! Log in daily and receive 2 free tokens. That's enough for a JD Match scan every day. Consistency wins the job hunt."
},
{
  q: "Will recruiters know my resume was AI-optimized?",
  a: "Not with AISkillScore. Unlike other tools that rewrite your resume into generic 'spearheaded' language, we enhance YOUR voice. Our #1 rule: no detectable AI cliches."
},
{
  q: "How is the Lifetime Deal different from token packs?",
  a: "Token packs are one-time purchases. The Lifetime Deal ($49) refills 100 tokens every month forever, with a 300 token cap. Need more in a busy month? Top up with any pack."
},
{
  q: "Can AISkillScore help me make money while job hunting?",
  a: "Yes. Every tool surfaces freelance and consulting opportunities based on your skills. The Entrepreneurship Assessment and Career Roadmap include income-building plans you can start this week."
},
{
  q: "What data does the AI use about me?",
  a: "Only what you provide: your resume text, job descriptions you paste, and any career profile info you enter. We never scrape your accounts, and we auto-delete data after 90 days."
}

## 4. Token Economics & Pricing Strategy

### 4.1 Current Pricing

| Pack | Tokens | Price | Rate | API Cost/Token | Margin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | 50 | $5 | $0.10 | ~$0.005-0.02 | 5-20x |
| Pro | 200 | $15 | $0.075 | ~$0.005-0.02 | 3.75-15x |
| Power | 600 | $39 | $0.065 | ~$0.005-0.02 | 3.25-13x |
| Lifetime | 100/mo | $49 one-time | $0.041 (month 1) | ~$0.005-0.02 | Decreasing over time, break-even ~24 months |

### 4.2 Daily Free Credits System

**Implementation**:
- Award 2 tokens per day for authenticated login
- Tokens credited on first page load after midnight UTC
- Maximum accumulation from daily credits: 14 tokens (1 week buffer)
- Daily credits are separate from purchased tokens and expire after 7 days
- Track in database: `daily_credits_balance` column on profiles, `last_daily_credit_at` timestamp

**Rationale**:
- 2 tokens/day = 1 JD Match scan daily for free, creating a sticky daily habit
- 7-day expiry prevents hoarding and encourages daily engagement
- After 5 days of daily use, the user has enough for a Skills Gap analysis (5 tokens)
- Weekly accumulated credits (14) cover an interview prep + salary research

**UI Integration**:
- Show in nav badge: "5 + 2 daily" (purchased + daily separate)
- Dashboard reminder: "Log in tomorrow for 2 more free tokens"
- Paywall: "Need more? Come back tomorrow for 2 free credits, or grab a pack now."

### 4.3 Lifetime Subscription with Monthly Cap + Topup

**Current model**: $49 one-time, 100 tokens/month forever, unused tokens cap at 300.

**Enhanced model**:
- Keep the $49 one-time price and 100 tokens/month
- Cap at 300 tokens (prevents hoarding)
- **New: Allow token pack topup** -- lifetime subscribers can buy any pack to add tokens beyond the monthly refill
- **New: Priority processing** -- lifetime subscribers get faster model routing (use premium tier models for all tools)
- Track purchased tokens and lifetime tokens separately in the database

### 4.4 Affiliate Revenue Projections

Based on course platform commission structures:

| Scenario | Monthly Active Users | Affiliate Click Rate | Conversion Rate | Avg Commission | Monthly Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conservative | 1,000 | 5% | 3% | $8 | $12 |
| Moderate | 10,000 | 8% | 5% | $12 | $480 |
| Optimistic | 50,000 | 10% | 7% | $15 | $5,250 |

Primary affiliate integration points:
1. **Skills Gap tool** -- course recommendations (highest conversion potential)
2. **Career Roadmap tool** -- course + tool recommendations
3. **Entrepreneurship tool** -- platform and tool recommendations
4. **LinkedIn tool** -- LinkedIn Learning course recommendations

### 4.5 Revenue per User Model

**Free user journey**:
- Sign up: 5 free tokens
- Daily credits: 2/day (60/month if daily active)
- Total free monthly tokens: ~65
- Can run: Displacement (free) + ~6 JD Matches + 1 Interview Prep + 1 Salary
- Conversion trigger: When they want Resume Optimizer (10 tok) or Cover Letter (3 tok)

**Paid user journey** (Starter $5):
- 50 tokens + 60 daily = 110/month
- Can run a FULL job application: JD Match (2) + Resume (10) + Cover Letter (3) + Interview (3) + Salary (3) = 21 tokens
- 5 full applications per month at Starter level

**Lifetime user journey** ($49):
- 100 tokens/month + 60 daily = 160/month
- 7+ full applications per month
- Break-even vs Pro pack: month 4 (vs $15/mo equivalent)
- Lifetime value at 12 months: $49 one-time vs $180 in Pro packs
